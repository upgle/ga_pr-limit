# ga_pr-limit
Creating an action to block the number of PRs any team member can use.

The motivation behind this action is to limit the number of PRs any actor can work on. This action puts a limit to multitasking and put the focus on ownership on already opened PRS.

If an actor exceeds that limit the PR will be automatically closed and a comment will be added to it.
